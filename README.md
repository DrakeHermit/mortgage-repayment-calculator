## My process

I always start with making the mobile first version and after that I started adding all the logic needed. After I was satisfied how the logic worked I finished it off with some minor improvements and added some quality of life features, and then topped it all off with making it responsive for both tablet and desktop devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot building out this project, and it was a great experience for me to build it out and fix all the bugs I came across. I learned a lot about managing state for input elements, how focused and error states worked. Also working with context again helped me understand the concept better. I also worked with scss for the first time and I actually enjoyed working with it.

### Continued development

My plan is to keep on improving my react knowledge, along with learning TS better. I want to start using tailwind since it's becoming a hassle to constantly switch between the component I'm working on and the css file.
